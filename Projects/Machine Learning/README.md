| Subscription Length | Duration of customer subscription |
| Satisfaction Score | Customer satisfaction rating |
| Support Tickets | Number of support tickets raised |
| Monthly Spend | Customer monthly expenditure |
| Discount Offered | Discount percentage applied |
| Last Activity | Days since last platform activity |

### Technologies
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
